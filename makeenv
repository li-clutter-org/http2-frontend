# Hello! It would be nice if whenever we need to change this (or any other)
# file, we do it in such a way that it works for everybody. One option would be
# for example to put a symlink somewhere so that each of us can have his/her
# virtualenv wherever he/she wants. Or a file. Look to what I did below:

# For this to work, I need to do:
#
#   $  cp venv/bin/activate run/venv_activate
#
# you can do
#
#   $ cp ../envpython3/bin/activate run/venv_activate
#
# and then use this script as usual!
